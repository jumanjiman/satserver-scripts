Create release channel
by: Brent Holden <bholden@redhat.com>


Description:
	This program is originally based on Justin Sherrill's create-channel-to-update.pl which required the user to download RPMs and import them.

	The purpose of this script can create a channel to a specific update level (i.e. RHEL4u3) when given a package manifest list in text format
	(included in /data directory).


For help, simply run ./create-release --help or ./create-release with no options

In addition to the script, you should find in this directory:
data/   - Data files for all of the update releases.
README  - This file
COPYING - GPLv2 under which this program is licensed
